## Readme

This is a tool to export multiple planar faces within your Fusion 360 project at once, without having to create a sketch and then export this sketch to a DXF-File for every single face individually.

I wrote this because when i do laser cutting i often find my self in the situation where I have multiple parts of an assembly (e.g. a box or a housing) and exporting one surface after another is time consuming.
